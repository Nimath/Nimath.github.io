*'A Forgotten Turning‑Point in the History of Differential Forms from [this paper of Hans Samelson](https://www.math.toronto.edu/mgualt/wiki/samelson_forms_history.pdf) '*

##  Setting the Scene  

Modern paper on differential forms always refer to  “early days”  usual heroes – Clairaut, Euler, Poincaré, de Rham.  
What Samelson *found* instead was the contribution of the work of the Italian mathematician **Vito Volterra (1860 – 1940)**. 
In fact, the celebrated *Poincaré Lemma*  appeared a decade earlier, embedded in a trilogy of short notes by Volterra – notes that also anticipate the exterior derivative, the Hodge star, and even the Laplacian on forms.

##  Volterra’s Leap Beyond Functions  

Volterra entered the story via his study of *“funzioni delle linee”* – functionals of curves and, later, 
of higher‑dimensional manifolds in $$\mathbf{R}^n$$.  
He defined an **r‑functional**  $$\phi$$ on closed r‑manifolds, 
demanded an *additivity* property: given two manifolds $$S_1,S_2$$ we have

$$\phi(S_{12}) = \phi(S_1)+\phi(S_2)$$ 

where $$S_{12}$$ is $$S_1\cup S_2$$ with the common submanifold removed.
Then he introduced the object we now call the **exterior derivative**:

$$d\phi(S):=\phi(\partial S)$$

where $$\partial S$$ is the boundary of an oriented manifold $$S$$ of dimension $$r+1$$.

From this deceptively simple rule he extracted a full algebra of skew‑symmetric coefficients, 
observed that $$d^2=0$$   (“closedness”), and, crucially, **proved both directions of the lemma that 
a closed form on a star‑shaped domain is exact** – decades before the lemma became standard textbook fare. 

###  Other gems in the Volterra notes  

* **Hodge star & codifferential.**  Volterra explicitly defined the $$\ast$$ operator

  $$\ast dx^{i_1} \ldots dx^{i_r} = dx^{j_1} \ldots dx^{j_{n-r}}$$

  where the $$i_u$$ together with the $$j_v$$ form an even permutation of $$1,...,n$$. Then $$d^*=\pm \ast d\ast$$.  
   
* **Laplacian identity.**  He established

  $$d d^*+d^*d=\Delta$$

foreshadowing the modern Hodge theory of harmonic forms.

* **Conjugate forms.**  Seeking an analogue of analytic conjugation, he called two forms $$\omega$$ (degree r–1) and $$\kappa$$ (degree n–r–1) *conjugate* when $$\ast d\omega  = d\kappa$$, a striking pre‑Yang–Mills viewpoint.  

In short, Samelson argues, **“Poincaré’s lemma is really Volterra’s theorem.”** 

(unless some earlier author
appears)

##  Why Was Volterra Forgotten?  

Samelson hints at several reasons: Volterra published in the *Rendiconti dei Lincei* (less visible to French and German geometers), he phrased everything in the language of functionals rather than forms, and his later political exile (he refused Mussolini’s loyalty oath in 1931 and lost his chair) severed many academic ties.

##  Beyond Differential Forms – Volterra’s Wider Mathematical Legacy  

| Theme | Signature Contribution | Lasting Impact |
|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Integral equations** | **Volterra integral equation** of the second kind, the **Volterra operator** | Corner‑stone of functional analysis and numerical quadrature schemes.  |
| **Functional analysis** | Early systematic use of *functionals*; coined the term _calculus of variations in function space_ | Positioned him, along with Fréchet and Hadamard, as a founder of the discipline.  
| **Mathematical biology** | **Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model** (1926) | Still the introductory model in population dynamics and ecology.  |
| **Series & operators** | **Volterra series** for nonlinear system response | Used in control theory and neuroscience.  |
| **Elasticity & PDEs** | Work on the equilibrium of elastic bodies and cylindrical wave equations | Influenced 20th‑century continuum mechanics.  |

##  Take‑aways for Today’s Reader  

*Re‑reading Volterra shows how ideas sometimes **arrive fully formed but linguistically disguised**.*  
Had his “functions of manifolds” been translated into the now‑standard tensor notation a generation earlier, the history of modern geometry might list **Volterra next to Cartan and de Rham**.  

For graduate students the moral is clear: **trace ideas to their original papers – and mind the language barrier.**
