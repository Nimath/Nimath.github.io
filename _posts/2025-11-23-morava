*The Lévi-Strauss’ Canonical Formula Through Morava’s Mathematical Lens*

### *How two mathematical papers shed new light on the algebra of myth*

Claude Lévi-Strauss’s work on myth has always balanced somewhere between anthropology and abstract thought. His famous *canonical formula*—enigmatic, elegant, often misunderstood—has puzzled/inspired scholars for decades:

$$
F_x(a) : F_y(b) \longrightarrow F_x(b) : F_{a^{-1}}(y)
$$

(usually $$\to$$ is replaced by some kind of equivalence $$\cong$$)
Is this philosophy? Linguistics? Algebra? Poetry?

Mathematician Jack Morava, recently passed away, argues that the formula isn’t mere metaphor. It can, in fact, be given a **precise mathematical interpretation**, one that reveals the structural logic Lévi-Strauss was reaching toward.

# **1. The Canonical Formula in a Nutshell**

Let’s start with the formula itself:

$$
F_x(a) : F_y(b) ;\longrightarrow; F_x(b) : F_{a^{-1}}(y)
$$

The idea is that a myth often contains:

1. **Two terms** (like *king* vs *beggar*, or *human* vs *monster*)
2. **Two functions** (like *honor* vs *dishonor*, or *creation* vs *destruction*)
3. A **transformation** that swaps and inverts elements to resolve or re-express a contradiction.

For Lévi-Strauss, the essence of mythical thought is not in the terms themselves, but in these transformations:
**Myths manipulate the structure of relations rather than the content of actions.**

Morava’s question is:

> *Can this transformation be modeled using real mathematics?*

His answer, across two papers, is **yes**—at least as a consistent formalization and possibly not the unique one.

---

# **2. Paper I (2003): A First Mathematical Model**

Morava’s 2003 note, *On the canonical formula of C. Lévi-Strauss*, is short and exploratory. His goal is modest but bold:

> Provide a mathematical interpretation of the canonical formula using a small non-commutative group.

He focuses on the **quaternion group**:

$$
Q = {\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k}
$$

This group is famous in algebra:

* it is finite,
* non-commutative (order matters),
* and rich in symmetries.

Morava observes that the CF essentially requires a transformation that sends:

* ( a \mapsto b )
* ( b \mapsto y )
* ( y \mapsto a^{-1} )
* ( x \mapsto x )

He shows that **there exists an anti-automorphism** of the quaternion group that performs exactly this mapping.

In this model:

* the **terms** (a, b)
* the **functions** (x, y)
* and even the **inverse** (a^{-1})

are represented as **elements of the group**, while the entire CF becomes a statement about how an anti-automorphism transforms one “ratio” into another.

### Why non-commutativity matters

If a myth transforms *king → beggar* differently than *beggar → king*, the operation can’t be symmetric. The order of operations matters in myth just as it does in group theory.

This is the first hint that the algebra might match the anthropological phenomenon.

### What the paper achieves

Morava’s first paper is a proof of concept:

* the canonical formula **can** be interpreted mathematically,
* the quaternion group gives one coherent model,
* and the transformation in the formula corresponds to a real algebraic symmetry.

He is careful to note: he’s not claiming myths *are* quaternions—only that the structure Lévi-Strauss described has a meaningful mathematical form.

# **3. Paper II (2020): Deepening the Structure**

Seventeen years later, Morava returned to the problem with a more mature, nuanced, and powerful approach.

His second paper, *On the canonical formula of C. Lévi-Strauss II* (2020), introduces:

* **the binary octahedral group** (a more complex non-commutative group),
* a mapping ( \Phi ) that assigns each ( (x, a) ) pair to an element of the group,
* a detailed analysis of the transformations induced by an anti-automorphism,
* and a philosophical discussion of modeling, metaphor, and cross-disciplinary translation.

### A key result

He constructs a function:

$$
\Phi : (x, a) \mapsto \text{element of } 2O
$$

and shows that:

$$
{\Phi_x(a) : \Phi_y(b)}
\quad \xrightarrow{\lambda} \quad
{\Phi_x(b) : \Phi_{a^{-1}}(y)}
$$

That is, the mathematical symmetry **exactly mirrors** Lévi-Strauss’s canonical transformation.

### What this means

Morava now demonstrates:

* the CF is **not a linguistic metaphor**,
* it’s an **algebraically expressible transformation**,
* and its logic resembles how finite groups encode symmetries.

Where Paper I says “this is possible,”
Paper II says “this is structurally robust.”

### Philosophical depth

The second paper spends significant time examining:

* the difficulty of translating between anthropology and algebra,
* the under-determined nature of the formula (what exactly are x, a, y, b?),
* and the idea that the subject perceives not terms, but **relations between relations**—a deeply structuralist insight.

This is perhaps the most Lévi-Straussian part of the mathematics:
the formula encodes not characters but *transformations of transformations*.

# **4. How the Mathematical Model Helps Us Read Myths**

Let’s move from algebra to storytelling.

The canonical formula describes a myth as a structure of paired oppositions:

* kingship vs poverty
* creation vs destruction
* purity vs impurity
* human vs non-human
* life vs death

and describes how these opposition-pairs **transform** inside mythic logic.

Morava’s interpretation helps us see these transformations with mathematical clarity.
Let’s look at some concrete mythic examples.

---

# **5. Myth Example A: King and Beggar**

Let:

* ( a = \text{king} )
* ( b = \text{beggar} )
* ( x = \text{honor} )
* ( y = \text{dishonor} )

The “initial state” of society is:

$$
F_x(a) = \text{king is honored}
$$
$$
F_y(b) = \text{beggar is dishonored}
$$

So we have:

$$
F_x(a) : F_y(b)
$$

Now apply the canonical transformation:

$$
F_x(b) : F_{a^{-1}}(y)
$$

This yields:

* the beggar becomes honored (often a disguised god or hero),
* while the king receives dishonor (exiled, dethroned, humiliated).

This is the logic behind:

* Cinderella
* Odysseus disguised as a beggar
* the Buddhist jātaka tales
* “king for a day” and carnival inversion rituals
* Lear as wandering madman

The myth *systematically inverts* the social terms—exactly as the algebra describes.

---

# **6. Myth Example B: The Flood Narrative**

Let:

* ( a = \text{wicked humanity} )
* ( b = \text{chosen survivor} )
* ( x = \text{destruction} )
* ( y = \text{preservation} )

We begin with:

$$
F_x(a) = \text{the many are destroyed}
$$
$$
F_y(b) = \text{the one is saved}
$$

After transformation:

$$
F_x(b) = \text{the survivor undergoes destruction}
$$

Indeed, Noah, Utnapishtim, or Deucalion all suffer survival as trauma:
loss of homeland, death of society, radical isolation.

And:

$$
F_{a^{-1}}(y) = \text{preservation applied to the “inverse” of humanity}
$$

Humanity is **reborn** from a purified, post-human fragment.

Thus the myth shifts from:

* “destroy many / save one”

to

* “test the saved / rebuild the destroyed.”

The canonical formula captures this narrative symmetry with surprising accuracy.

# **7. Myth Example C: Oedipus and the Sphinx**

Let:

* ( a = \text{humans} )
* ( b = \text{monsters} )
* ( x = \text{overvaluation of kinship} ) (incest)
* ( y = \text{undervaluation of kinship} ) (infant exposure)

Original:

$$
F_x(a) = \text{Oedipus commits incest}
$$
$$
F_y(b) = \text{Sphinx devours youth (kinship collapses)}
$$

Transform:

$$
F_x(b)
$$

The monster now *tests* kinship norms (riddle of “the man who…”).

And:

$$
F_{a^{-1}}(y)
$$

Oedipus, no longer human in social terms, becomes an exile—outside kinship entirely.

Thus the myth shifts from excess kinship → zero kinship, mediated through the monster.
Exactly the structure the formula encodes.

# **8. Why Morava’s Interpretation Matters**

Morava is clear: the quaternion group is not hiding in Greek tragedy. Myths are not secretly algebra.

But structural patterns—**inversions**, **swaps**, **correspondence between pairs**, **resolutions of contradiction**—can be modeled mathematically, and Lévi-Strauss’s formula anticipates this.

His two papers show:

* the canonical formula is not nonsense;
* its logical structure is formalizable;
* myth operates on transformations that resemble group symmetries;
* and anthropology can fruitfully borrow from algebraic thinking.

Just as geometry was once a theory of shapes and became a theory of transformations, so the study of myth may transition from motifs to **transformational patterns**.

If we accept Lévi-Strauss’s premise that mythical thought is a kind of **bricolage**, a manipulation of available symbolic materials, then group theory—especially in its finite, non-commutative forms—serves as a profound metaphor and a workable model.

---

# **9. Conclusion: Algebra, Anthropology, and the Logic of Story**

Morava’s two papers invite us to take Lévi-Strauss at his structuralist word: myths do not merely tell stories; they perform **operations** on symbolic categories.

The canonical formula is not a single equation but a **template for transformation**.
It describes the way myths move from:

* human ↔ monster
* king ↔ beggar
* life ↔ death
* pure ↔ impure
* belonging ↔ exile

—swapping terms, inverting categories, resolving deep contradictions.

The mathematical models in Morava’s papers illuminate this movement. They show that the formulas of myth, like the symmetries of geometry, may express a fundamental combinatorial logic.

In that sense, Lévi-Strauss wasn’t being obscure.
He was being exact—just ahead of his time.
