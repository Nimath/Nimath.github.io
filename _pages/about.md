Research Interests
------
My research sits at the crossroads of arithmetic geometry and \$p\$-adic Hodge theory. I am mainly intersted in understanding how  \$p\$-adic cohomology theories (de Rham, syntomic, rigid)  capture the arithmetic of varieties and 1-motives. 

I am equally interested in the motivic viewpoint. I have introduced and refined Fontaine–Ogus and filtered Ogus constructions for Laumon 1-motives, produced rigid syntomic ring spectra, and analysed cycle classes through the syntomic regulator. These projects clarify how the different cohomological avatars of a motive interact and how they encode special-value phenomena predicted by the conjectures of Beilinson and Bloch–Kato.

In a nutshell, my research often reduces to computations of Ext groups and differential forms in an artihmetic context.

Short Bio
------
Since 2023 I have been an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Padua, after serving as a Ricercatore di tipo B (tenure-track assistant professor) there from 2020 to 2023. Before returning to Padua, I was a Maître de Conférences at the Université de Bordeaux (2012-2020), following post-doctoral appointments at the University of Padua and at Paris Diderot (IMJ-PRG) and an early-stage fellowship at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.

I earned my Laurea Magistrale with honours from Padua in 2005 and my Ph.D. from the University of Milan in 2009.
